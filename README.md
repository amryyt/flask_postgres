# Flask PostgreSQL Docker Project

This repository contains a Dockerized Flask application connected to a PostgreSQL database. The project provides a simple Flask web app that can interact with the PostgreSQL database, and the Docker setup includes a VNC server for GUI access. It's designed to help you quickly deploy a Flask app with a PostgreSQL backend and graphical access to the container.

## Docker Image Build Instructions

To build the Docker image, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amryyt/flask_postgres.git
cd flask_postgres
2. Build the Docker image:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t amryyt/flask_postgres .
This command will build the Docker image based on the Dockerfile in the repository.

Running the Container
Once the image is built, you can run the container using the command below. This will expose the required ports for your application and services.

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9001:9001 -p 22:22 -p 5432:5432 -p 5901:5901 --name flask_container amryyt/flask_postgres
Exposed Ports:
Port 8000: Flask web application (accessible via your browser)
Port 9001: VNC server (for graphical access)
Port 22: SSH access (for remote access to the container)
Port 5432: PostgreSQL database (for database connection)
Port 5901: VNC server (for GUI access)
Accessing the Flask Web Application
After starting the container, open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8000
This will show the Flask web application running.

Connecting via VNC
To access the graphical interface of the container via VNC, follow these steps:

Install a VNC client (e.g., RealVNC, TigerVNC, etc.).
Connect to the VNC server using the following details:
Host: localhost
Port: 5901
Password: rootpassword (set in the Dockerfile)
You’ll now be able to interact with the container’s desktop environment.
