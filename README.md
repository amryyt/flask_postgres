## Docker Image Build Instructions

Follow the steps below to build and run the Docker image.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amryyt/flask_postgres.git
cd flask_postgres
2. Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t amryyt/flask_postgres .
This will create the Docker image based on the Dockerfile in the repository.

Running the Container
Once the image is built, you can run the container with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9001:9001 -p 22:22 -p 5432:5432 -p 5901:5901 --name flask_container amryyt/flask_postgres
This command will:

Run the container in detached mode (-d)
Map the necessary ports to your local machine for web access, SSH access, PostgreSQL, and VNC
Exposed Ports:
Port 8000: Flask web application (accessible via your browser)
Port 9001: VNC server (for graphical access)
Port 22: SSH access (for remote access to the container)
Port 5432: PostgreSQL database (for database connection)
Port 5901: VNC server (for GUI access)
Accessing the Flask Web Application
After starting the container, open your web browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8000
You should be able to see the Flask application running.

Connecting via VNC
To access the container's graphical interface, follow these steps:

Install a VNC client (e.g., RealVNC, TigerVNC, etc.)
Connect to the VNC server with the following details:
Host: localhost
Port: 5901
Password: rootpassword (set in the Dockerfile)
This will allow you to interact with the container's desktop environment.

Docker Hub Image URL
You can pull the Docker image directly from Docker Hub using the following URL:

https://hub.docker.com/r/amryyt/flask_postgres

This will give you access to the latest version of the image if you want to avoid building it yourself.

GitHub Repository URL
